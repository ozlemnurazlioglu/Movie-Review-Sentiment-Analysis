Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of positive and negative movie reviews, which are preprocessed and classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Features

Reads movie reviews from text files

Preprocesses the data by removing empty reviews

Converts text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets

Trains a sentiment classification model using a Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Evaluates model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-review-classification.git
cd movie-review-classification

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:

python sentiment_analysis.py

Dataset

The dataset consists of two folders:

neg/: Contains negative movie reviews.

pos/: Contains positive movie reviews.

Each file represents a single review.

How It Works

Load Data: Reads text files from positive and negative review folders.

Preprocessing: Checks for missing values and removes blank reviews.

Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical form using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Evaluation: Tests the model and provides performance metrics.

Results

The model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are displayed at the end of execution.
